onkyo-button is a Python script that controls the sound volume on an Onkyo receiver, via a button connected to the GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi. I've included the instructions here as a record for myself and to share my code with anyone who might want to build a similiar project.

## Requirements
* Raspberry Pi
* Perma-Proto Pi Hat
* [Waterproof Button](http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/E-Switch/ULV8F2BSS331/?qs=sGAEpiMZZMvxtGF7dlGNpo%2fFeg65f8WWDggtHu1m1ZQ%3d)
* Michael Elsd√∂rfer's excellent [Onkyo eISCP python library](https://github.com/miracle2k/onkyo-eiscp)
* [RPi.GPIO](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPi.GPIO)
* [psutil](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psutil/)

## Software Install
To install the software just run 
```
pip install onkyo-button
```

# Hardware Construction
Since the button was down an approximately 100' wire, I needed to construct a simple circuit to protect the GPIO pins and the Raspberry Pi.  Here's the circuit design.

Here's a picture of the Hat layout:
